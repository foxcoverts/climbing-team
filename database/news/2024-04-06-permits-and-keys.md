The bookings system is working well, over half of our members have activated their accounts and started responding to bookings. We have been busy adding a record of everyone's **qualifications and permits**, and adding a system to track who has the **office keys**.

## Qualifications and Permits

The team leader for a booking is now able to view the in-date qualifications held by anyone attending the booking; this will help them to deliver safe sessions. We will be adding a screen for people to see their own qualifications, although your definitive record will be the Scouts website. We do not plan to add any permit expiry notifications, as the county already has a robust notification system in place. Please let the Team Leader know when you get any new climbing permits or qualifications so that we can keep the records here up to date too.

## Office Keys

The team has a few keys to access the climbing equipment store - these are shown around the website by a small key symbol on the guest list. Please update the website or let the **Team Leader** know when you pass a key on to someone else so that we can keep track of the keys. If you are running a weekend booking you can also get a key from the warden if needed.

## Roll Call

Team leaders are now able to take a register of members turning up to bookings, even if you have previously said you cannot make it; this will allow them to see contact details and qualifications for the team present on the day. Please try to keep your attendance up to date if possible as this will help team leaders to plan for the booking.

## Next up

We have ordered some new climbing team **neckers** for anyone who has not got one, and will be adding a screen to track who has got a necker. The Team Leader and District Lead Volunteer are also looking at a process for ordering climbing team **clothing**, which will be managed through the website. There are plans to add useful documents, including the team's **risk assessments**, and a process for recording **near misses and incidents**. Please keep passing your bugs and feedback along.
